## Get started

2. Put it in a Drupal 8/9 theme folder of your choice.
3. `$ cd path/to/theme` to the theme.
4. Continue to next step.

### Installation
1. To download and install the starterkit's dependenices, run `$ yarn`.
2. Continue to next step.

### Development
You're now ready start working with the starterkit.

You have a bunch of different commands available, take a close look in `package.json`.

To start compiling and watching for changes in CSS and JavaScript, and start browserstack and the webpack dev server, run:
`$ yarn run watch`.
